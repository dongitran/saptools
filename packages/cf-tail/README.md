# 🛰️ `@saptools/cf-tail`

**Tail every app in a Cloud Foundry space at once — chronologically merged, filtered, and redacted.**

Built on top of [`@saptools/cf-logs`](../cf-logs). Discover all started apps in
a `region/org/space`, fetch their recent logs in parallel, and stream them live
into a single multiplexed feed with strong filtering and bounded local
persistence.

## ✨ Features

- 📥 **Space-wide snapshots** — fetch recent logs for every started app in a CF
  space in parallel, with a configurable concurrency limit.
- 🧬 **Chronological merge** — every row carries its `appName` and rows from all
  apps are merged by timestamp into a single timeline.
- 📡 **Multiplexed live stream** — one `cf-tail stream` process tails every app
  at once, with per-app color, prefixed labels, and auto-rediscovery as apps
  appear or disappear.
- 🎯 **Powerful selection** — `--apps a,b`, `--include-regex`, `--exclude`,
  `--exclude-regex` to scope the fan-out.
- 🧰 **Cross-app filtering** — level, search, source, tenant, status range,
  stream (`out`/`err`), `--since`/`--until` time windows, `--max-rows`.
- 📊 **Summary view** — `cf-tail summary` aggregates level counts, source
  buckets, status buckets, tenants, first/last timestamps per app.
- 🚨 **Errors shortcut** — `cf-tail errors` is `snapshot --level error` across
  the whole space.
- 🔐 **Redaction** — SAP credentials are redacted before any output or
  persistence; you can add custom secrets via `--extra-secret` or programmatic
  options.
- 🗃️ **Bounded local store** — aggregate snapshots cached at
  `~/.saptools/cf-tail-store.json` with atomic writes and locking. Per-app raw
  logs continue to live in the cf-logs store.
- 🧪 **Fake-backed e2e** — discovery, snapshot, stream, summary flows all pass
  without live SAP access.

### `cf-tail apps`

```bash
cf-tail apps \
  --region ap10 \
  --org sample-org \
  --space sample \
  --include-regex "^demo-" \
  --exclude demo-canary \
  --json
```

### `cf-tail snapshot`

Fetches recent logs for every matching app in parallel, merges into a single
chronological timeline, applies row filters, and optionally persists.

```bash
cf-tail snapshot \
  --region ap10 \
  --org sample-org \
  --space sample \
  --apps demo-app,api-app \
  --level error \
  --since 30m \
  --max-rows 100 \
  --json
```

| --- | --- |
| `--save` | Persist redacted per-app snapshots to the cf-logs store and an aggregate entry to the cf-tail store |
| `--concurrency <n>` | Maximum apps fetched in parallel (default 4) |
| `--log-limit <count>` | Maximum parsed rows and bounded raw-text size per app |

### `cf-tail errors`

Shortcut for `snapshot --level error`:

```bash
cf-tail errors --region ap10 --org sample-org --space sample --since 1h
```

### `cf-tail summary`

Aggregate counts for every matching app:

```bash
cf-tail summary \
  --region ap10 \
  --org sample-org \
  --space sample \
  --json
```

### `cf-tail stream`

Multiplex live logs for every matching app. By default, the runtime
re-discovers the app list every 30 seconds, picking up newly started apps and
dropping stopped ones. Use `--rediscover off` (or `--rediscover 0s`) to disable.

```bash
cf-tail stream \
  --region ap10 \
  --org sample-org \
  --space sample \
  --include-regex "^api-" \
  --rediscover 60s
```

| `--rediscover <duration>` | Re-discover the app list at this interval (e.g. `30s`, `2m`, `off`) |
| `--flush-interval-ms <ms>` | Batch window before append events are emitted |
| `--retry-initial-ms <ms>` | Initial reconnect delay after unexpected stream exits |
| `--retry-max-ms <ms>` | Maximum reconnect delay |
| `--log-limit <count>` | Maximum parsed rows and bounded raw-text size per app |
| `--save` | Persist bounded redacted stream appends into the cf-logs store |

### `cf-tail store path | list | clear`

```bash
cf-tail store path
cf-tail store list
cf-tail store list --json
cf-tail store clear
```

### `cf-tail --version`

Prints the installed `@saptools/cf-tail` semantic version.

## 📁 Store File

The aggregate cf-tail store lives here:

```text
~/.saptools/cf-tail-store.json
```

It contains one entry per `(apiEndpoint, org, space)` with:

- `fetchedAt`, `updatedAt`
- `appCount`, `rowCount`
- `apps: [{ appName, rowCount, truncated }, ...]`

Per-app raw text continues to live in the existing cf-logs store at
`~/.saptools/cf-logs-store.json` (used when you pass `--save`). The cf-tail
store is metadata only.

Prefer `readTailStore()`, `persistTailSnapshot()`, `cf-tail store path`, or
`cf-tail store list` over parsing the file directly.

---

## 🔐 Security Notes

- The runtime redacts the current SAP email and password before emitting or
  persisting log content. Pass `extraSecrets` (programmatic) or
  `--extra-secret <value>` (CLI, repeatable) to add custom redaction rules.
- Persisted snapshots are bounded and written with file locking plus atomic
  replace semantics.
- Neither store file is safe for public repositories. Even after redaction,
  they still reveal app names, org names, spaces, endpoints, and log content.
- If your application logs contain additional secrets beyond SAP credentials,
  add custom runtime redaction rules before persisting or forwarding output.

## ❓ FAQ

<details>
<summary><b>How is this different from <code>@saptools/cf-logs</code>?</b></summary>

`cf-logs` is single-app focused: one `--app` per CLI invocation, one key per
store entry, one redaction set. `cf-tail` is multi-app: discovery, parallel
snapshot, multiplexed live stream, chronological merge, cross-app filtering,
and an aggregate store. It builds on `cf-logs`, not against it.

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Do I still need <code>cf-logs</code> installed?</b></summary>

`cf-tail` depends on `@saptools/cf-logs` automatically. Install
`@saptools/cf-tail` and you get both.

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Does <code>stream</code> automatically pick up new apps?</b></summary>

Yes — every `--rediscover` interval the runtime re-runs `cf apps`, computes the
diff, starts streams for new apps, and stops streams for apps that are no
longer started.

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>How do I scope to a single app?</b></summary>

`--apps demo-app` (or `--include demo-app`). Same shape as `cf-logs`'s
single-app commands once you scope down.

</details>
